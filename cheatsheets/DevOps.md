## IaC - Infrasturcture as Code

Approaches:
* declartive: The declarative approach defines the desired state and the system executes what needs to happen to achieve that desired state.
* imperative: Imperative defines specific commands that need to be executed in the appropriate order to end with the desired conclusion.

Methods:
* pull: the server to be configured will pull its configuration from the controlling server.
* push: In the push method, the controlling server pushes the configuration to the destination system.
